This project builds a full predictive modeling pipeline to estimate movie box-office revenue using H2O AutoML. Using a dataset of 506 films, the workflow includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, model training, ensemble selection, deployment, and business-focused interpretation. The final Stacked Ensemble model explains ~90% of revenue variance and provides actionable insights for forecasting future film performance.

Project Objectives

Identify which features most strongly influence movie revenue.

Build an automated machine learning pipeline using H2O AutoML.

Evaluate multiple models (GBM, DRF, Deep Learning, Ensembles).

Deploy the top-performing model for scoring new films.

Deliver a clear, business-ready report for stakeholders.

Key Results

Top Model: Stacked Ensemble (Best of Family)

Test R²: ~0.898

Test RMSE: ~$6.24K

Top Predictors: Budget, Trailer Views, Multiplex Coverage

Use Case: Pre-release forecasting, marketing allocation, scheduling decisions

How to Run the Pipeline

Install dependencies:

pip install h2o pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib


Ensure Java (JDK 17+) is installed for H2O.

Run the script:

python movie_regression_h2o_pipeline.py


The model will train, evaluate, output diagnostics, and save the best model.

Files Included
